						   <h3>Unifying Expression</h3>
Last session we have arrived to an unifying expression for the three thermodynamic probability distributions we have learn so far:
                    $$\boxed{ \mathcal{N}(E)={1\over B e^{E/k_B T}-\epsilon}}$$
                    with $\epsilon=1$ for boson,  $\epsilon=-1$ for fermions, and  $\epsilon=0$ for Boltzman or classical/semiclassical systems.
                    Lets plot and compare them at a given temperature. At low temperatures we have,
						   <center>   <img src="{% static "img/bolt_bose_ferm.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>
According to this plot, what statement is true:

		 <li>The majority of Bosons are found at low energies whereas Fermions are more evenly distributed among many energies.   </li>
		 <li>For low energies we expect Bosons to follow an approximate Boltzmann distribution.   </li>

        <!-- they converge to each other, or in other words, they all become the Boltzmann distribution. Quantum behaviour is relevant at low temperatures, while at high energies, a classical approximation is a good enough description. -->
	Including some more higher energies:
							   <center>   <img src="{% static "img/bolt_bose_ferm0.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>
		    From this plot we learn:
<ul>
		    <li>At high temperatures, particles are spread out sparsely over
individual-particle states. With occupation numbers much less
than 1, it is irrelevant whether the particles are bosons, fermions, or
		      classically distinguishable and the quantum distributions thus agree
		      with the classical. </li>
		    <li>At low temperatures, bosons tend to congregate in
the lowest-energy individual-particle state, while fermions tend to
		      fill states, one particle per state, up to some maximum energy.</li>
</ul>

                    <h2>The Fermi Distribution</h2>
                    The Fermi distribution is particularly important for electronic devices, such us semiconductors. <br><br>
                   
                    At NOT-so-low temperatures, it looks like
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/ferm_ht.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>
                    Low energy states are fully occupied, whereas high energies states are rarely occupied.
<br><br>
At low enough energies, the occupation number is  one,  at some point, called the Fermi Energy $E_F$, the occupation number is $1/2$.
                    By using this definition of $E_F$, we can compute $B$ for the Fermi distribution: 
$\mathcal{N}(E_F)={1\over2}$ lead us to $$B=e^{-E_F/k_B T}\,,$$ or 
 $$ \mathcal{N}_{fermi}(E)={1\over e^{(E-E_F)/k_B T}+1}\,.$$

Notice that $E_F$ is a constant as long as $B$ remains a constant, which is the case in most practical applications. <br>

                   
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/ferm.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>

At low enough energies,  low energy states are again fully occupied, i.e the occupation number is  one,,  at the Fermi Energy $E_F$, the occupation number is $1/2$, after that it sharply drops to zero. For very low temperatures,  all  states with $ E< E_F$ are occupied, while almost all states with $E > E_F$ are empty!.   
<br><br>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Metals:<br>
                            Under the free electron model, the electrons in a metal can be considered to form a Fermi gas, with a Fermi energy of the order of 2 to 10 electronvolts.</li>

                         <li>   White dwarfs:<br>
                             Stars known as white dwarfs have mass comparable to the Sun, but have about a hundredth of its radius. The high densities mean that the electrons are no longer bound to single nuclei and instead form a degenerate electron gas. Their Fermi energy is about 0.3 MeV.</li>

                           <li> Nucleus:<br>
                         Gases of protons and/or neutrons are also fermion gases. A typical value for the Fermi energy in suchs systems is usually given as 38 MeV.</li>
                    </ul>
		    <h2>Conduction Electrons</h2>
		    Conduction electrons are good example of a fermion gas.  We can effectively describe electrons in a cristal by a potential well.
		    <br><br>
		    
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/electrons_in_well.png" %}" width="300"></center><br><br>
		    Electrons down lower energy levels are kind of "trap", whereas electrons on the top energy levels have plenty of energy-space to occupy and the propagate over the top layer as almost free particles.  <br><br>
		    The Work function, the minimum energy required to remove an electron from a metal, is also explained by the Fermi distribution, it is simply the energy difference between the Fermi energy and the top of the finite well in which the conduction electrons are bound,
		    $$\phi=U_0-E_F\,. $$

		    <h2>The Bose Gas and Bose-Einstein Condensation</h2>
		    As we have see from the plot of the Bose distribution, it is very large near $E= 0$.  Under normal conditions, namely large temperatures, gases are so diffuse that it is irrelevant whether the particles are bosons or fermions.	However, as we lower the temperature, Bose and Fermi gases depart sharply. Whereas a Fermi gas prefer to accomodate particles in many energy levels. Contrary, in a Bose gas, particles crowd themselves into the lowest-energy quantum state. This produces an state of Both are consequences of extreme order where many of the particles move essentially as one. One important effect due to this ordered behavior is <b>superfluidity</b>, a fluid with zero viscosity, or zero resistance to deformation.

		    <h2>Massless Bosons: The Photon Gas and the Black Body Radiation</h2>

                    Photons being spin one particles obey Bose statistics. We would like to compute the average energy of a gas of photons:
                    $$\overline{E}={\int E\mathcal{N}(E)D(E)dE\over\int \mathcal{N}(E)D(E)dE}={1\over N}\int E\mathcal{N}(E)D(E)dE\,,$$
                    with 
                    $$ \mathcal{N}(E)={1\over B e^{E/k_B T}-1}\,.$$ For the sake of simplicity, lets take the constant $B=1$. In the case of photons, the density of states is given by $$D(E)={8\pi V\over h^3 c^3}E^2\,. $$ Finally, using the fact that $E=h f$ for a photon, we end up with the following expresion:
                    $$\boxed{\bar{E}_{\rm photon~~ gas}={8\pi V\over N c^3}\int_0^{\infty}{h f^3\over e^{hf/k_B T}-1}df\,.} $$
                    Once more we have derived the black body radiation spectral density (integrand above), but this by considering the energy distribution of a gas of photons.  In hindsight, black body radiation is nothing else but a gas of photons at thermal equilibrium.
                    <h2>The Laser</h2>
                    As an important application of the above gas of photons, let us quickly review the laser. <br><br>
                    Quite probably, from all the modern scientific discoveries of the last century, the laser is the most important and disrupting technology.  With applications ranging from eye surgery, communication devices, nuclear fusion, information storage and retrieval, barcode readers, precision measurement devices, holography, among many others. <br><br>
                    The key aspect to create laser light  is to produce coherent light,  which can be roughly defined as light traveling the same direction with the same  phase. By contrast ordinary light is im no directions on a broad spectrum of wavelengths. Light from ordinary sources is produced mostly by<b> spontaneous emission</b>, meaning from  photons coming from electrons falling lower energy states,  However there are other interactions between photons and atoms that can be exploited to produce coherent light, namely <b>absorption</b> and <b>stimulated emission.</b><br>
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/laser0.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>
                    Lets assume our system to be a gas of atoms and photons. Let's call $R_{sp}$, $R_a$, and $R_{st}$ the rate of spontaneous emission, abosorption and stimulated emission respectively, also $N_1$ and $N_2$ the number of atoms at the lower and upper level. Then we should have,
                    $$R_{sp}= L_{sp}\,N_2\,,$$ with $A_{sp}$ a constant. Similarly, if we requiere an energy $\Delta E=E_2-E_1$ to excite an atom at level  the lower level $E_1$ to the upper level $E_2$,  and we have $Y(\Delta E)$ photons available within the gas with such energy, then we have,
                    $$R_{a}=G_{a}\, N_1\, Y(\Delta E)\,, $$
                    and similarly,
                    $$R_{st}=L_{st}\, N_2\, Y(\Delta E)\,. $$
                    Now, if the system is at equilibrium, we should expect that the energy being released by an atom is equivalent to the energy being gain, otherwise the atom will be giving energy to the environment by losing internal energy lowering its temperature. In other words, at equilibrium, the so called "principle of detail balance" should be satisfied,
                    $$L_{sp}\,N_2+L_{st}\,N_2 Y(\Delta E)=G_{a}\,N_1 Y(\Delta E)\,. $$ Noticing that $${N_1\over N_2}=e^{\Delta E\over k_B T} $$ and solving for $Y$, we get,
                    $$Y(\Delta E)={ {L_{sp}\over G_{a}}\over e^{\Delta E\over k_B T}-{L_{st}\over G_{a}} }\,. $$
                    However, $Y(\Delta E)$ is the number of photons with the energy $\Delta E$, or in other words, the Bose occupation number at the given energy, so comparing side by side, both expressions agree if ${L_{st}\over G_{a}}=1$ ( up to a normalization constant).<br><br>
                    Now rather obvious what should we do in order to produce a large number of coherent photons from the system: simply by making $N_2 >> N_1$, we will induce  $R_{st}>> R_{a}$. It is equally obvious that such situation will not occur naturally and we need to take the system out equilibrium. Such overpopulation of higher levels is known as <b>population inversion</b>.<br><br>
                    Unfortunately, since physical systems will prefer to stay at the lowest energy levels, we need to play tricks in order to produce population inversion, even if only for a fraction of time. One such a trick, is done by the three-level laser.  In such a system we have a very cold ($k_B T< \Delta E$) gas of atom with three-energy levels, as shown below. At equilibrium the system is basically in the ground state. When energy is pump into the system  some electrons move upwards to higher energy levels.  Once the pump is stopped spontaneous emission occurs. 
                    The key aspect is that spontaneous emissions times between levels are several orders of magnitude different, say electrons leave $E_3$ at a rate $\Delta t\sim 10^{-8}$s but $E_2$ at a rate $\Delta t\sim 10^{-3}$s, and therefore, once $E_3$ has been depopulated, we have $10^{-3}$ seconds of population inversion.<br><br>
                    In practice pumping need not be stop and we can get a continuous output as long as pumping keeps ahead of stimulated emission by keeping $E_2$ occupied.<br><br>
The basics elements of a laser can be described by the following cartoon:
