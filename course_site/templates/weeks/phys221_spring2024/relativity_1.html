	 <h2>Some (very short) Historical Remarks</h2>
		 <br><br>
		 <b>Classical Physics </b> attained a cohesive form in the late 1600 with the work of Sir Isaac Newton. It went unchallenged for two centuries, until the end of the 1800s. Additionally, Electromagnetism was a complete theory by the mid of the 19th century mainly from the work of James Clerk Maxwell. Such was the state of affairs of physics around the turn of the twentieth century (late 1800s, early 1900s) that many physics thought physics was a completely understood subject, so much so, that one of the most important contributors to the revolution about to come and one of the most renowned scientist of this very university, Albert A. Michelson, stated:
		 <br><br>
		 "<em>The more important fundamental laws and facts of physical science have all been discovered, and these are now so firmly established that the possibility of their ever being supplanted in consequence of new discoveries is exceedingly remote.</em>"
<br><br>
However, around that same time a series of experimental results were unexplained by the current understanding of the physical laws. To mention a few:
<ul>
  <li> <b> Uranus and Mercury Orbits:</b> The orbit of the planet Uranus (and later Mercurys) was found to deviate slightly from what Newton’s laws predicted</li>
  <li><b> Black body radiation and the UV catastrophe:</b>
    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/thermal_rad.jpg" %}" width="500"></center><br>
    The thermal electromagnetic emission of a "purely thermal" system, was carefully measured giving, reasonably, a finite result, however Maxwell EM theory predicted an infinite result!! </li>
  <li><b>Photoelectric Effect:</b>
    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/photovoltaic_cells.jpg" %}" width="500"></center><br>
    By shining light on a conductor metal, it was observed that electrons where ejected from the metal surface, regardless the intensity of the light but strongly dependent on the color of the light.  by Maxwell theory, the opposite should have occurred!.</li>
  <li> <b>Atomic spectra:</b>
     <center>   <img src="{% static "img/balmer.png" %}" width="500"></center><br>

    Light emitted from atoms gives a discrete pattern of colors, not a continuous pattern as expected.</li>
  <li><b> Michelson-Morley:</b>
    <br> Think of two cars (red and blue) moving in one dimension (say $x-$ direction). You are going in the red car at 10m/h  and see a blue car ahead of you. You observe the blue car is neither getting farther away from you nor getting closer. What can you said about the speed of the blue car:
		  <ol  style="line-height:200%" type="A">
		     <!-- longer -->
		 
		     <li> Is less than the red one?</li>
		     <li> Is the same as the red one. </li>
		     <li> Is greater than the red one. </li>
		     <li> I dont know.</li>
		   
		  </ol>
		  <br><br>
 While still going in the red car at 10m/h you see another blue car ahead of you coming towards you. You observe this new blue car is coming towards you at 20m/h. What can you said about the speedometer of the (incoming) blue car:
		  <ol  style="line-height:200%" type="A">
		     <!-- longer -->
		 
		     <li> Is displaying 20 m/h</li>
		     <li>  Is displaying 10 m/h </li>
		     <li>  Is displaying 0 m/h </li>
		     <li> I dont know.</li>
		   
		  </ol>

In 1887, Michelson (a professor of physics at the Case School of Applied Science), and Morley (a professor of chemistry at Western Reserve University), measure the difference between the speed of light as observed when coming in the direction of Earth motion and any other direction. Within experimental error, this difference was negligible.
<br>
    The speed of light is independent of earth motion!.</li>
    
</ul>
In the search for solving the puzzles brought by this experiments, a giant revolution took place in the early 1900s, which completely changes our understanding of the laws of nature, and as a consequence,many aspects of all of our lives.  This advances can be split in three  main subjects: <b> The theory of Special Relativity, Quantum Mechanics</b> and <b> Quantum Statistical Mechanics</b>, which encompass what we now call <b>Modern Physics</b>.

		  Special Relativity was proposed and developed by A_____________.
		  <br>
		  <br><br>
                  An object experiencing zero net force is know as a  f___ object.<br><br>

		  <h2>Conceptual questions: </h2>

Let's think a bit: Which are good approximation to an inertial frame of reference?

		  <br>
		  <br>
		  <ol  style="line-height:200%" type="A">
		     <!-- longer -->
		     <li>A train coasting at constant speed on a level track.</li>
		     <li> A train rolling down a steep hill with constant acceleration.</li>
		     <li> Your bedroom.</li>
		     <li> All of the above. </li>
			</ol>

<!-- Inertial frame of reference is one moving with constant  -->
<!-- velocity (no acceleration) so answer  is <b> A</b>. -->
 		  First Einstein’s fundamental postulate of special relativity can be stated as:
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  <ol  style="line-height:200%" type="A">
		     <!-- longer -->
			  <li>The form of each physical law is different in all inertial frames.</li>
		     <li> The form of each physical law is the same in all inertial frames</li>
		     <li>Only the form of the laws of mechanics are the same in all inertial frames.  </li>
		     <li> All velocities are relative to the speed of light.</li>
			</ol>
		  <br><br>

		  <br><br>

      A light bulb puts out a pulse of light that spreads out
in all directions.  According to Einstein the speed at which the light moves to the right is
<br><br>
		  <ol  style="line-height:200%" type="A">
		     <!-- longer -->
<li> slower for an observer moving to the right than for an 
  observer sitting with the light bulb.</li>		
		     <li> the same speed for both observers.</li>
		    <li> faster for the observer moving to the right than for an
		      observer sitting with the light bulb.  </li>
		   	</ol>

 <hr>
		  <hr>
		 
		  <br><br>
		 <em> Let's recap</em>: Einstein’s fundamental postulates of special relativity can be stated as follows:<br>
		  <div class="box">
		    
		    1. The form of each physical law is the same in all inertial frames.<br>
		    2. Light moves at the same speed relative to all observers.</div>
		  <br><br>
		  <hr><hr>
		  Which of the following examples can be cosidered as an Event in special relativity:
		  <ol  style="line-height:200%" type="A">
		     <!-- longer -->
		     <li> A plane passing by. </li>
		     <li> A lightning. </li>
		     <li> A hand catching a ball.</li>
		    <li> None of the above  </li>
		   	</ol>
		  <br><br>  <em>Think-Pair-Share (TPS).</em> Pair and share with your neighbor. Vote after I tell you so.
 <hr>
		  <hr>
		  In few words: <em>An Event is a anything with a single localtion and a single given time. A single coordinate in space time $(t,x)$.</em>
