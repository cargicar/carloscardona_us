		  Lets take a look at the light spectrum <br><br>
 				 <center>   <img src="{% static "img/EM_spectrum.png" %}" width="700"></center>        <br><br>

Considering only the visible spectrum, what of the following is wrong?:

   <li>$E(violet) > E(red)$ </li>

<br><br>
		 Lets go back to the blackbody.  Replacing $f={c\over \lambda}$ into the spectral energy density, and after some boring algebra (that will go into HW), we get,
		 $${dU\over d\lambda}={8\pi V h c\over e^{hc/\lambda k_b T}-1}{1\over \lambda^5}\,. $$ which is a bit more useful. Notice that $dU/ df$ peaks at certain frequency. Computing the maximum in terms of wavelength, we get,
		 $$ \lambda_{max}T=2.898\times 10^{-3}m\cdot K $$
		 which is known as the <b>Wien's law</b>.

<h2>Photoelectric Effect</h2>
In the 1880s, Heinrich Hertz
demonstrated that a light beam directed at the surface of a metal could liberate
electrons. This is called the <b>photoelectric effect</b> —light producing a flow of
electricity—and is depicted in Figure
		</br><br>
		<center>   <img src="{% static "img/photo_electric.png" %}" alt="photo_electric" width="500"></center> <br><br>
		<h3>Classical expectation (pre-quantum mechanics)</h3>
		If light were strictly a wave, we should expect:
		<ul>
		  <li> If light of one wavelength is able to eject electrons, then light of any wavelength should be able to do it.</li>
		    <li>Independent of the wavelength, the rate at
		      which energy arrives (the intensity)—and therefore the rate at which electrons are ejected—could be made arbitrarily large simply by increasing the intensity </li>
		 <li>If the intensity is low, then even though electrons might still be ejected, a measurable time lag should arise. Because a wave is diffuse, considerable time
		   might be needed for enough energy to accumulate in the electron’s vicinity</li>
<li> Finally, at any given frequency, if the intensity is increased,
the departing electrons should be more energetic. A stronger electric field
  should produce a larger acceleration.</li>
<br><br>
Let us take a look at the
 <a style="color: navy;" target="blanck_" href="https://applets.kcvs.ca/photoelectricEffect/PhotoElectric.html">  experimental set-up </a>. <br><br>

		  A typical experimental curve for the photoelectric effect is shown below:
		  		 <center>   <img src="{% static "img/photoelectric_exp.png" %}" width="700"></center>       

				 <br><br>
				 Some observations:<br><br>
				 The electron are bound to the metal by some force, and an amount $\phi$ of energy is required to freed an electron. This energy $\phi$ depends on the material and is know as the <b>work function</b> of the given material.<br><br>  Intensity= energy per unit time per unit area= $Energy/(A t)$ and current <br><br>
				 <center>   <img src="{% static "img/elec_current.png" %}" width="700"></center> <br><br>
				 the electrical current give us a measure of the number of charges.        
				 What are we observing?<br><br>
				 
				 Say we start with a positive potential difference and increase it until we reach the right flat region.  From the following assertions, what do you think is the right interpretation of that flat region?
				 
	<br>	 		 		        <img src="{% static "img/voting_cards.png" %}" width="100"> <br>
		 <ol style="line-height:300%" type="A">
		   <li>Intensity of light is larger towards the right of the plot</li>
		   <li>Area with moving electrons is increasing as we move to the right </li>		  
		    <li>Number of electrons reaching the right plate stop increasing as me move to the right </li>
		   <li> I don't know</li>

		 </ol>
		 <br><br><br>
		 The flat region indicates that as we increase the potential from negative to positive, the number of electrons quickly reach a maximum and does not change from that.<br><br>
		 Now lets think about the left end of the curve. First lets us think on the meaning of $\Delta V$: an electron that leaves the surface has kinetic energy $E_K$. It gained this energy from the incident electromagnetic wave. In the space between the electrodes, a photoelectron moves in the electric potential and its energy changes by the amount $-e\,\Delta V$. The stopped voltage $\Delta V_s$ is defined as exactly the value at which not more current, i.e, no more electrons reach the right plate, so in other words, even the electron with the largest kinetic energy is stopped from reaching the right plate, or:
		 $$E_{K_{max}}=e\,\Delta V_s$$ 

		 What do you think is a right interpretation for the left end of the experimental plot?
		 <br>
		 	<br>	 		 		        <img src="{% static "img/voting_cards.png" %}" width="100"> <br>
		 <ol style="line-height:300%" type="A">
		   <li>Higher light intensity implies higher (more negative) stopping potential?</li>
		   <li>Stopping potential is independent of the intensity of light </li>		  
		    <li>Stopping does not depend on current. </li>
		   <li> I don't know</li>

		 </ol>
		 <br><br>
		 We can see where the classical theory is at odds with the experimental results. In classical theory,
the photoelectron absorbs electromagnetic energy in a continuous way; this means that when the incident
radiation has a high intensity, the kinetic energy is expected to be high. But the experiment shows that the
		 maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons is independent of the light intensity.<br><br>
		 <h3>Cut -off frequency</h3>
		 It was additionally observed, that low-intensity light of $500 nm$ wavelength ejects electrons from sodium, with no time lag, while light of $600 nm$
wavelength cannot, even at many times the intensity, but according to the classical
description, the kinetic energy of photoelectrons should not depend on the frequency of incident radiation at
		 all, and there should be no cut-off frequency.<br><br>
		 This results leads to Einstein in 1905 to consider seriously Planck's hypothesis, that the energy of light depends on it's frequency in a quantized fashion. In Einstein's approach, a beam of monochromatic light of frequency $f$ is made of particles, called <b>photons</b>. A <b> photon</b> is a particle of light and carries an energy $$E_f=h\, f\,.$$
		 In Einstein's interpretation, each photon gives away all its energy to only one electron on the metal surface, because only integer numbers of $h\,f$ are available, so the photon can't give away just a fraction. This explains the frequency cut-off, if an photon has energy $E_f=h\,f<\phi $, then there
is simply insufficient energy in any given photon to free an electron. So none are
freed, no matter how high the intensity. However, if the
																																						 frequency is high enough, such that $h\,f>\phi$, then electrons can be ejected,<br><br>
		   then the cut-off frequency will be given by the condition
 	<br>	 		 		        <img src="{% static "img/voting_cards.png" %}" width="100"> <br>
		 <ol style="line-height:300%" type="A">
		   <li> $f_c={\phi\over h}$</li>
		   <li> $f_c={\phi}$ </li>		  
		    <li>$f_c={ h}$ </li>
		   <li> I don't know</li>

		 </ol><br><br>
		
		    For higher frequencies, energy conservation tell us:
		   $$E_f=E_{K_{max}}+\phi\,,\quad{\rm or}\quad E_{K_{max}}=h\,f-\phi$$
		   The subscript $max$ refers to the fact that the maximum energy an electron can gain is all what is left from overcoming $\phi$.

		   <br><br>
		   Einstein’s interpretation of the photoelectric effect explains not only the
observation that a certain minimum frequency is required but also the other
classically unexpected results. If a single photon—<em>a particle of concentrated
energy </em> rather than a diffuse wave—does have enough energy, ejection should
be immediate, with no time lag. Also, the electron’s kinetic energy should
depend only on the energy of the single photon—the frequency—not on how
many strike the metal per unit time (the intensity). In all respects, Einstein’s
explanation agrees with the experimental evidence, and the achievement
earned him the 1921 Nobel Prize in physics.

<h2>Is it a wave or a particle? </h2>
                        <p>Well, is both, but it depends on how the size of the corresponding wave compares with the size of the "relevant dimensions" of the phenomena at hand. When the wavelenght $\lambda\sim D$ then we will be able to percieve the wave nature. When however $\lambda<< D$ we will perceive it as a particle (c.c. make a drawing) </p>

                        <h2>Double Slit Experiment</h2>
                        <p> One easy an classical experiment to distinguish a wave from a particle is the double slit experiment, in which a "beam" is passed through a two small slits of size comparable to $\lambda$. If the "beam" is truly a wave, then one should observe an interference pattern at the screen.</p>
                

                        </br></br>
                    <p>    Solving the geometrical problem represented in figure above, we can see that if an interference pattern is observed, bright (constructive) spots will be located at the screen location:</br></br> $\boxed{y_{bright}={\lambda L\over d}m}$  with  $m\in \mathbb{Z}$.</br></br>
                        Similarly, darks spots will be at,
                        </br></br> $\boxed{y_{dark}={\lambda L\over d}(m+1/2)}$  with  $m\in \mathbb{Z}$.</br></br>
                    </p>

                        <h2>Bragg Law</h2>
                        <p>
                        In 1927, Davisson & Germer from Bell labs were studying scattering of electrons off a Nickel cristal, and they observe the following pattern on a film placed to detect the scattered electrons,
                        <center>   <img src="{% static "img/electron_inter.jpeg" %}" alt="double_slit" width="500"></center>

                        Which is nothing else but an interference pattern <span style='font-size:30px;'>&#128563;</span>.  What  Davisson & Germer had performed inadvertently, was a sort of double slit experiment using electrons instead of light, but instead of a double slit, they use the crystal structure of Nickel, whose atomic interspace is in the order of nm. <br><br> Let us see an schematic representation of such "double slit":

                        <center>   <img src="{% static "img/bragg.gif" %}" alt="double_slit" width="500"></center>
                        For this, Davisson & Germer won the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physics.
                        <br><br>
                        By performing the same gymnastics used for the double-slit configuration, we arrive to the <b>Bragg Law</b>
                        <br><br>
                        $2d {\rm sin}(\theta)=\lambda$.<br><br>
                        For which the family duo, won the Noble prize in 1915 ( in reality, they came out with this formula while studying X-ray difraction on cystals, but the same applies for electrons, which are also a wave ).

                        <br><br>
 Davisson & Germer experiment, provides convincing evidence of the wave nature of electrons, which is a fundamental massive particle!. In turn, suggesting that all matter should exhibit some sort of wave behaviour!
                        <h2>Matter Waves</h2>
Now suppose we perform a truly double slit experiments with electron, what would we see?
                       <br><br>
                       <center>   <img src="{% static "img/bragg.gif" %}" alt="double_slit" width="500"></center><br><br>
                       From the statistical point of view, the "amoung" of electrons on different regions of the screens should be associated with the probability of finding an electron in such region (i.e, the more electrons in a region after a millions of electrons being fired, the more the probability of finding an electron there). From the wave point of view, the "intensity" of a region is given by the square of the amplitude of the resulting wave, and such, the natural conclusion to make is: <br><br>
                       <center> <em>The probability of finding a particle in a region is proportional to the square of the  wave function associated to that particle in that region.</em></center> <br><br>
                       Or in mathematical terms:<br><br>
                       <center>$P(e^{-},x)=|\Psi(x,t)|^2$</center> <br><br>
                       This lead us to the ask: In a EM wave, the stuff oscilatting are the E & M fields. What is then oscillating in a Matter wave?. R:  The probability of finding the particle is the oscillating phenomena &#129327;

                       Another important observation to make is that, a neccesary requirement for creating a wave interference pattern, is that both interfering waves need to be coherent and have equal amplitudes. This implies that a given electron, similarly as a wave, need to pass through both slits AT THE SAME TIME! &#129327; &#129327;. (it is what it is).

                       <br><br>
                       The wavelenght for matter carries an special name, is it called <b>de Broglie wavelength</b> and is given simple by adopting the same relation as the photon $\lambda={h\over p}$. This relation is <b>universal</b>- true for all phenomena. <br><br>
                       Similarly, the frequency of a wave of matter is given by $E= h f $ or $f={E\over h}$. <br><br>Now the fundamental difference between radiation waves and matter wwaves is that matter wavelength varies inversily with the mass. Thats the reason why we humans don't see our wave &#128546;. Luckily, the crystal atomic interspace is small enought to be of the order of an electron de Broglie wavelength. Subsequently, difraction patterns are observed using much heavier particles, such neutrons or even atoms. <br>
                       Similarly to the case of light, the wave or particle behaviour depends on the size of $\lambda$ wrt relevant scales (draw the double slit situation).
                        </p>

                        <h2>The Schrödinger equation</h2>

                        The wave equation for matter fields is given by the Schrödinger Equation

                        \begin{equation}
                        -{\hbar\over 2 m}{\partial^2\Psi(x,t)\over\partial x^2}=i\hbar{\partial\Psi(x,t)\over\partial t}\,,
                        \end{equation}
                        where $\hbar=h/2\pi$.
