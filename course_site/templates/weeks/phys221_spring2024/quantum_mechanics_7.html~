		                     		  <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
		  <ol>		    
		    <li>Learn the equation obeyed by matter waves </li>
		    <li>Learn that the wave function of a particle is related to a probability density </li>
		  </ol>
                  <h2>The Schrödinger equation</h2>
                    Every wave obeys a wave equation. We can derive the wave equation of a wave on a string or on a body of water, by using Newton's first and second law (since they are both mechanical waves). Or we can derive the EM wave by combining Maxwells equations. <br><br>

                    The wave equation for (free) matter fields is given by the Schrödinger Equation

                    \begin{equation}
                    -{\hbar^2\over 2 m}{\partial^2\Psi(x,t)\over\partial x^2}+U(x)\Psi(x,t)=i\hbar{\partial\Psi(x,t)\over\partial t}\,,
                    \end{equation}
                    where $\hbar=h/2\pi$.,<br><br>
                    At a first look this equation does not look very intuitive, and a satisfactory derivation probably does not exist. However, let us perform a non-rigorous derivation, which will allow us to gain some insight into the equation.<br><br>
                    For that, let us consider two things we already know, one about particles and the other about waves. The energy of a particle is given by:
                    \begin{equation}
                    E=K+U ={p^2\over 2m}+u(x)
                    \end{equation}
                    and plane wave moving in direction $x$ is described by the wave equation:
                    \begin{equation}
                    \Psi=A {\rm e}^{i(k x- w t)}
                    \end{equation}
                    We also need a couple of relations we have seen last session relating wave quantities and particle quantities: Momentum $\fbox{$p=\hbar k$}$ and energy of quantum particle $\fbox{$E=\hbar\omega$}$.
                    <br><br>
                    Using the plane wave expression, one can see that ${d^2\Psi\over dx^2}$ is equal to: 
       <br>	 <img src="{% static "img/iclicker.png" %}" width="100"> <br>
		 <ol style="line-height:300%" type="A">
		   <li>$\quad\left({p^2\over \hbar^2}\right)\Psi$ </li>
		   <li>$\quad i\left({p^2\over \hbar^2}\right)\Psi$ </li>
		   <li>$\quad-\left({p^2\over \hbar^2}\right)\Psi$ </li>
		   <li> I don't know how to take derivatives</li>
		
		 </ol>
		 <br><br><br>

                    ${d^2\Psi\over dx^2}=(ik)^2\Psi=-\left({p^2\over \hbar^2}\right)\Psi$
                    or equivalently $\fbox{$-\hbar^2 {d^2\Psi\over dx^2}=p^2\Psi$}$.<br><br>
                    Now, taking the derivative of $\Psi$ wrt time, we get:
                    \begin{equation}
                    {d\Psi\over dt}=-i\omega\Psi=-{i\over \hbar}E\Psi
                    \end{equation}
                    What implies $\fbox{$E\Psi=i\hbar{d\Psi\over dt}$}$.
                    <br><br>
                    which finally allow us to write:
                    \begin{equation}
                    E\Psi={p^2\over 2m}\Psi+u(x)\Psi\quad\rightarrow\quad\boxed{-{\hbar^2\over 2m} {d^2\Psi\over dx^2}+u(x)\Psi=i\hbar{d\Psi\over dt} }
                    \end{equation}
                    <mark> And therefore the  Schrödinger equation is nothing else but the energy of the wave/particle</mark> &#128526;.

                    Few clarifications are in order: Both the wave equation and its solution are complex. On the other end, the things that we measure will be real. The probability density associated to a quantum particle is given by the square of its wave function $|\Psi|^2$, which is real. Remeber the square of a complex number $ |\Psi|^2=({\rm Re}\Psi)^2+({\rm Im}\Psi)^2\,.$
					 <br><br>
					 
					 <hr>
					 <h2> Wave Normalization, Expectation Values and Uncertainties: formal introduction </h2>
					 The square modulus of the  wavefunction  is associated to the probability density:<br><br>
					 <em>probability of finding a particle in a region of space $V$ at time $t$ equals: </em>$ P_{V}(t)=\int |\Psi(\vec{r},t)|^2 dV $
					 <br><br>or the one dimensional version
					 <em>probability of finding a particle in an interval of space $[a,b]$ at time $t$ equals: </em>$$ P_{[a,b]}(t)=\int_a^b |\Psi(x,t)|^2 dx\,. $$
					 <br><br>
		 A quantum particle has a wave function given by
		 \begin{equation}
		 \psi(x,t)=A \,e^{i(kx-\omega t)}
					 \end{equation} 
 What is the probable position of the particle?

                    <h2>Expectation Values, Uncertainties and Operators in QM</h2>
                    The <b> total expectation value</b> for the position  $x$ of a quantum particle is given by the mean or average value:
                    \begin{equation}
       \boxed{             \bar{x}=\langle x\rangle=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}xP(x)dx=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x|\psi(x)|^2dx}
                    \end{equation}
		    Equivalently, the <b>expectation value on the interval $[a,b]$</b>  is given by the mean value on that interval:
                    \begin{equation}
       \boxed{             \bar{x}_{[a,b]}=\langle x\rangle=\int_a^b xP(x)dx=\int_a^bx|\psi(x)|^2dx}
                    \end{equation}
		    <br><br>
		    The normalized wave function of a particle in one dimension looks like the following plot: 
<center>   <img src="{% static "img/gaussian.png" %}" width="500"></center><br><br>
What is the position where such particle is expected to be found?

  <li>$\langle x \rangle=  (0.40)$</li>
  <li>$\langle x \rangle= 0 $</li>
  <li>I don't know</li>
</ol>
<br><br>

		 <br><br>

                    The <b>uncertainty</b> of the position  $x$ in an interval $[a, b]$ is given by the standard deviation:
                    \begin{equation}
                   \boxed{ \sigma_{[a,b]}=\sqrt{\int_a^b(x-\bar{x})^2|\psi(x)|^2dx} }
                    \end{equation}
                    With some algebra, the uncertainty can be written in the following more convenient form:
                    \begin{equation}
                   \sigma_x=\sqrt{\overline{x^2}-\bar{x}^2}
                    \end{equation}
                <!--    The <b>expectation value of a function</b> of a variable $x$ in an interval $[a,b]$, is given by: -->
<!--                     \begin{equation} -->
<!-- \overline{f(x)}=\langle f(x)\rangle=\int_a^bf(x)|\psi(x)|^2dx\,. -->
<!--                     \end{equation} -->
		    <!--                     More generally, -->
		    In QM we define a <b>observable</b> as a quantity that can be measure. Mathematically, those observables are represented by operators action on the wave function of the particle, such as momentum, which is defined by the following differential operator:
                    \begin{equation}
                    \hat{p}=-i\hbar {\partial\over\partial_x}\,.
                    \end{equation}
Operators are usually denoted by a hat. Once an operator is determined in its mathematical form, we can compute its associated statistical central values by the obvious generalizations, such us, expectation value of operator $\hat{Q}$ is given by:
                    \begin{equation}
\overline{Q}=\langle Q\rangle=\int_a^b\Psi^*(x,t)\hat{
                    Q}\Psi(x,t) dx
                    \end{equation}
                    and its uncertainty by
                    \begin{equation}
                    \sigma_Q=\sqrt{\overline{Q}^2-\bar{Q}^2}\,.
                    \end{equation}
for example
         \begin{equation}
\langle p\rangle=\int_a^b\Psi^*(x,t)\hat{
                    p}\Psi(x,t) dx=\int_a^b\Psi^*(x,t)\left(-i\hbar {\partial\over\partial_x}\right)\Psi(x,t) dx
                 
                    \end{equation}
<br><br><br>


					 
                    <h2>Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</h2>
The <b>Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle</b>, states that the uncertainty (standard deviation) in the position of a particle times the uncertainty in the  momentum, is always bigger than half $\hbar$, i.e,
                    \begin{equation}
\boxed{                    \sigma_x \sigma_p \geq {\hbar\over 2}}
                    \end{equation}
                    <br><br>
                    Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states than, if you know the position with absolute accuracy, you don't know the momentum at all, and the other way around &#x1F92F;, or in other words, it is imposible to know precisely both position and momentum simultaneously: the uncertanty $\sigma_x$ and $\sigma_p$ cannot be zero at the same time. The more we know about one, the less we know about the other &#128561;.<br><br>
                    A good practical example of the uncertaninty principle can be seen from the plane wave. As we saw previously, it has an equal probability to be found anywhere in space, but on the other hand, it has a well determined momentum, given by $p=\hbar k$ (In mathematical terms, the Fourier transform of a plane wave is a Dirac's delta function $\delta(p-p')$).
                    <br><br>
                    How does the Uncertainty Principle does not contradict the classical laws of Newton?. From a classical perspective, one can use Newton's laws in order to determine, at least theoretically, the exact position and momentum of a body once we know the forces acting on it.<br><br>
		    The reason this does not contradict the uncertanty principle is because QM applies to physical systems at scales of order $\hbar$, in other words, in tipical macroscopic system the uncertainties in the measurements is way larger that $\hbar$ and effectivelly, we have $\sigma_x\sigma_p\geq0$ (In actuality, there would be always an uncertanty associated to the measurement.)<br>
                    We say that classical mechanics is deterministic, whereas quantum mechanics is non-deterministic, or more precisely, probabilistic.

                    <br><br>
                    <b>Energy-Time Uncertainty Principle</b>
The uncertainty principle is a bit more general, and involves any conjugate quantities (which can be related by Fourier transforms), such as Energy and time,
                    \begin{equation}
\boxed{                    \sigma_E \sigma_t \geq{\hbar\over2}}
                    \end{equation}
Some rare subatomic particles have a very short life span, say $10^{-20}$, giving us a quite good idea of its "position" in time, i.e $\sigma_t$ is small. In which case, we will have a large uncertainty in the energy, or equivalently, the mass of such particle. Another example is the change of a quantum state at a given energy level to another. This events are quite fast, having a large uncertainty in the energy "released" from the jump.<br><br>
                    <h3>On the limitations of knowledge</h3>
                    The uncertainty principle places limitations on our ability to know, even theoretically, exact quantities: We will never be absolutly certain &#129300;. Even more, the wave nature imposes several limitations beyond (even though related to) the uncertainty principle. Let's go back to the doble slit experiment and think on what we meant by knowing the position of a particle.
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/double-slit2.jpg" %}" alt="double_slit" width="300"></center><br><br>
                    What we want to mean by knowing, is that before the given particle hits the screen, we should be able to tell where at the screen the particle is going to hit, but we don't know, we just know the probability of the particle being in X or Y region. Now the particle hits the screen and we have measure it "actual" position. In order for that to happend, the measurment has altered the wave function of the particle, in order to give us "exact" certainty on its position. This is called the collapse of the wave function, and essentially implies that we can't know the location of a particle until we actually look at it, which now changes its wave function, is not the same thing anymore!, our measurement alter the very nature of the thing we were trying to measure  &#129324 . <br><br>
                    During the early days of QM, many prominent figures, including the Einstein, argued that the wave-particle duality nature must be incomplete, since a way to determine the "real" position, momentum, energy, etc... was lacking. However, the modern consensus asserts that until an observation is done, localizing the particle (or more generally, collapsing its wave function ), a particle simply  does not have a definite location (or momentum, etc..), this is today know as <b>The Copenhagen Interpretation.</b>
