                    Announcement:
                    <h2>Schrodinger equation in three dimensions</h2>
                    We have seen previously that in one dimension, the Schrodinger equation looks like:
                    \begin{equation}
                    -{\hbar^2\over 2 m}{\partial^2\over \partial x^2}\Psi(x,t)+U(x)\Psi(x,t)=i\hbar{\partial\over \partial t}\Psi(x,t)\,,
                    \end{equation}
                    and we also argued that this equation is based on energy considerations for a particle-wave object. <br></br>
                    The generalization to higher dimensions is almost obvious:
                    \begin{equation}
                    -{\hbar^2\over 2 m}\left({\partial^2\over \partial x^2}+{\partial^2\over \partial y^2}+{\partial^2\over \partial z^2}\right)\Psi(x,y,z,t)+U(x)\Psi(x,y,z,t)=i\hbar{\partial\over \partial t}\Psi(x,y,z,t)\,,
                    \end{equation}
                    However, higher dimensions introduce some complexities. For exampl, the SE written in rectangular coordinates as above, does not explote the spatial symmetries of particular problems, for example usual problems with spherical symmetry. Later we are going to use other more convenient coordinate systems, in which the SE adopt slightly diferent forms.
                    <h3>Probability density</h3>
                    As in one dimension, the square of the wave function represent the probability density, i.e, Probability per unit of lenght. In three dimensions we say that the square of the wave function represent the probability per unit of volume, or in math form
                    \begin{equation}
                   \int_{\rm all~~space}|\Psi(\vec{r},t)|^2 dV=1\,,
                    \end{equation}
                    <h3>Bound states</h3>
                    The analogous system to the square potential in three dimensions is the cube potential. The infinite well,  is represented by a potential that constrain  a particle to live in a cube with  an infinite potential energy:
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/cube.png" %}" width="400"></center><br><br>
                    As in one dimension, this type of potential have constant energy solutions, and therefore we might try to do separation of variables once again, but now in all four variables:
                    \begin{equation}
                    \Psi(x,y,z,t)=X(x)Y(y)Z(z)T(t)\,,
                    \end{equation}
                    Replacing that on the 3D SE, we get:
                    \begin{equation}
                    \sum^{X(x),Y(y),Z(z)} {1\over \Gamma(\gamma)}{\partial^2\Gamma(\gamma)\over\partial \gamma^2}=-{2m E\over \hbar^2}\,,
                    \end{equation}
                    implying that each term should be a constant:
                    \begin{equation}
                    {1\over \Gamma(\gamma)}{\partial^2\Gamma(\gamma)\over\partial \gamma^2}=C_{\gamma}\,,
                    \end{equation}
                    with $\Gamma=X,Y,Z$ and $\gamma=x,y,z$, whereas for the temporal piece:

                    \begin{equation}
                    {i\hbar\over T(t)}{dT(t)\over dt}=C_{t}\quad\rightarrow\quad T(t)=e^{-i{C_{t}\over\hbar}t}
                    \end{equation}
                    We are now in the familiar situation we were in one dimension, just that for two additional coordinates. There we have seen that the solution was of the form:

                    \begin{equation}
                    \Gamma(\gamma)=A_{\gamma}{\rm sin}{n_{\gamma}\pi\gamma\over L_{\gamma}}\,. 
                    \end{equation}
                    Here is worth doing some clarifications that I have ommited during the one dimension discussion. The most general solution to equation above is

                    \begin{equation}
                    \Gamma(\gamma)=A_{\gamma}e^{ikx}+B_{\gamma}e^{-ikx}\,.
                    \end{equation}
                    Since the wave can't penetrate an infinite potential (it would requiere an infinite initial energy), the probability of bounce in the boundary has to be equal to the probability of the incoming wave (in other words, transmision is zero), or $|A_{\gamma}|=|B_{\gamma}|$.  Additionally, we are positioning the cube as shown at the figure above, which in particular  imply that we want $\Gamma(0)=0$, which impose $A_{\gamma}=-B_{\gamma}$, leading us to the result quoted.<br><br>
                    The only actual difference with the case in one dimension, is that now we have three indepent solutions, which give us three contributing quantizations to the energy:

                    \begin{equation}
                    -{n_{x}\pi^2\over L_x^2}-{n_{z}\pi^2\over L_z^2}-{n_{z}\pi^2\over L_z^2}=-{2m E\over \hbar^2}
                    \end{equation}
                    with corresponding wave function:
                    \begin{equation}
                    \Psi(\vec{r})= A_{x}A_{y}A_{z}{\rm sin}{n_{x}\pi x\over L_{x}}{\rm sin}{n_{y}\pi y\over L_{y}}{\rm sin}{n_{z}\pi z\over L_{z}} \,. 
                    \end{equation}
                    We can define a single constant $A=A_{x}A_{y}A_{z}$. Each triple $(n_x,n_y,n_z)$ defines a three dimensional standing wave. Each new spatial dimensions leads to a corresponding <b>quantum number</b> contributing to the energy.<br><br>
                    As in one dimension, none quantum number $n_{\gamma}$ is allowed to become zero, since that will vanish the wave function and will violate the uncertanty principle. Then again, the lowes energy state, or ground state, corresponds to the energy at $(n_x,n_y,n_z)=(1,1,1)$.<br><br>

                    Unlike in one dimension, now is not quite obvious what state is the next energy level above the ground state (do some analysis here). <br><br> Even more, there might be multiple states with the same energy! This phenomena s know as <b>degeneracy</b>. To see why that is possible, lets take the actual cube $L_{\gamma}=L$, then:

                    \begin{equation}
                    E=(n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2){\pi^2\hbar^2\over 2mL^2}
                    \end{equation}
                    each triplet that satisfies the following equation
                    \begin{equation}
                    (n_x^2+n_y^2+n_z^2)=\epsilon\,,
                    \end{equation}
                    with $\epsilon$ a constant, defines a family of different wave functions with the same energy.
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/degeneracy.png" %}" width="400"></center><br><br>

                    $$ \Psi_{2,1,1}= A{\rm sin}{2 \pi x\over L_{x}}{\rm sin}
                    {1\pi y\over L_{y}}{\rm sin}{1\pi z\over L_{z}}\,, \qquad\Psi_{1,2,1} A{\rm sin}{n_{x}\pi x\over L_{x}}{\rm sin}{n_{y}\pi y\over L_{y}}{\rm sin}{n_{z}\pi z\over L_{z}}\,,$$
                    Unlike the pedestrian picture of degeneracy, in quantum mechanics it is an indication of beauty (ok, personal opinion), or more precisly, of symmetry. In the example above, it happens when the cube is a perfect cube, but if we deform it, even just a little, the degeneracy is lifted. For example, for the perfect cube $n_{\gamma}=$permutations$[(1,1,2)]$ are corresponding to the same energy:

                    \begin{equation}
                    E\sim {(1^2+1^2+2^2)\over L^2}
                    \end{equation}
                    whereas the deformed cube will produce different values, i.e:
                    \begin{equation}
                    {1^2\over(L+\delta L_{x})^2}+{1^2\over(L+\delta L_{y})^2}+{1^2\over(L+\delta L_{z})^2}
                    \end{equation}
is different for permutations of $(1,2)$ but it still degenerated for permutations of $(1,1)$, as long as $\delta_{x}\neq\delta_{y}\neq \delta_{y}$.

                    <h3>Particlelike waves: Fourier expansion</h3>
                    In general, any wave function can be written in terms of a Fourier expansion (or transform) as,

                    \begin{equation}
                    \Psi(x,t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}A(k)e^{i(kx-\omega t)}dk
                    \end{equation}
                    Let us recall what $\omega$ is: The Schroedinger equation for a free particle is given by:

                    \begin{equation}
                    -{\hbar^2\over 2m}{\partial^2\Psi(x,t)\over \partial x}=i\hbar{\partial\Psi(x,t)\over\partial t}\,.
                    \end{equation}
                    Applying it on a single plane wave component, we get ${\hbar^2 k^2\over 2m}=\hbar \omega$, or equivalently 

                    \begin{equation}
                    \omega(k)={\hbar k^2\over 2 m}
                    \end{equation}
                    The relantionship between frecuency and wave number is know as a <b>dispersion relation</b>. For comparison purposes, let us recall  that for a massless  particle $E=cp$, therefore 
                    \begin{equation}
                    \omega_{\rm photon}(k)=ck
                    \end{equation}
                    We still have an answer question what is the speed of a wave?. On the one hand, we can computed by dimensional analysis $[l]/[t]\quad\rightarrow\quad \lambda f$, which is defined as the <b>phase velocity</b>:

                    \begin{equation}
                    v_{\rm phase}={\omega\over k}\,.
                    \end{equation}
                    Then we have, for the photon $v_{\rm phase}=c$ but for a massive particle $v_{\rm phase}={\hbar k\over 2 m}$. Whereas EM waves move at $v_{\rm phase}=c$ matter waves can move faster than light?? &#128552;. Yes, they might, but remember, the wave function is a convenient description, and the actual physical quantities are the probabilities. Take for example the simpler linear combination of two planes waves having wave number centered around $k_0$.
                    \begin{equation}
                    |\Psi(x,t)|^2=4A^2~{\rm cos}^2[x dk-td\omega]\,.
                    \end{equation}

                    We can see that in $|\Psi(x,t)|^2$ both $\omega_0$ and $k_0$ are cancelled, so there is not phase velocity associated to such probability, however, there is still a velocity we can associated to it ${d\omega\over dk}$, which is known as the group velocity. Hencefort, in QM mechanics we are not concerned with the phase velocity but with the <b>group velocity</b>
                    \begin{equation}
                    v_{g}={d\omega(k)\over dk}(k_0)
                    \end{equation}
                    where $k_0$ is the one related to the speed of the particle, in other words, if the speed of the particle is $v_0=p_0/m=\hbar k_0/m$ (which is obviously less that $c$ &#128517; ). Also notice that the group velocity for a photon
                    \begin{equation}
                    v_{g}={d\omega(k)\over dk}(k_0)={d(c k)\over dk}(k_0)=c
                    \end{equation}
                    and is still equal to $c$. 
                    <br><br>
                    <em>No matter what is the phase velocity of the individual plane waves composing a wave function, the probability will move at the speed associated to the particle</em> &#129327;
