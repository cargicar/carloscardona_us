                    Announcement: 
                    <br><br>
                    Last class we have computed the average number of  particles at energy level $E_i$ (occupation number) by following the following steps: think we have a system of total energy $E$, total number of particles $N$ and put $n_i$ particles at a given energy $E_i$. Henceforth we need to distribute the remaining $E-E_in_i$ among the remaining $N-n_i$. Say there is $W(E-E_in_i,N-n_i)$ different ways of achieving such configuration, then:
                    $$P(E_i)={W(E-n_iE_i,N-n_i)\over \sum_i W(E-E_in_i,N-n_i)}\,. $$
                    An important observation is that $n_i << N $, and we can compute $P(E_i)$ approximately, by expanding in  small $n_i$. More explicitly, defining,
                    $$f(E(n_i),N(n_i))=\log W(E-E_in_i,N-n_i)\,,  $$
                    and Taylor expanding at first order in $n_i$ we get,
                    $$f(n_i<< N)=\log W(E,N)+n_i\left((-E_i){\partial\over \partial E}-1{\partial\over \partial N} \right)\log W(E,N)$$
                    Finally, using $S=k_B \log W$ and the definitions,
                    $$ {\partial S\over \partial Q}={1\over k_B T},\qquad ={1\over k_B} {\partial S\over \partial N}=\alpha\,, $$
                    where $\alpha$ is the chemical potential, we arrive to
                    $$W(E-n_i,N-n_i)=W(E,N)e^{-(\alpha+E_i/k_B T)n_i}\,. $$
                    Now, in order to compute the occupation number,
                    $$\bar{n_i}=\mathcal{N}(E_i)=\sum_in_i P(E_i)\,, $$
                    we need to carry over the sum.  This can be done easily, as we have seen in previous classes, by using the geometric series, leading us to an unifiying expression for the three energy distributions we have learn so far:
                    $$ \mathcal{N}(E_i)={1\over B e^{E_i/k_B T}-\epsilon}$$
                    with $\epsilon=1$ for boson,  $\epsilon=-1$ for fermions, and  $\epsilon=0$ for classical/semiclassical particles!.
                    Lets plot and compare them at a given temperature. At low temperatures we have,
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/bolt_bose_ferm0.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>
                    where they look very differently. However, for high energies we have,
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/bolt_bose_ferm_high0.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>
                    they converge to each other, or in other words, they all become the continous limit of the Boltzmann distribution.<br><br>
                   Take away: <em>At high temperatures particles are spread out sparsely over individual-particle states, with occupation numbers much less than one. It is irrelevant if the particles are bosons, fermions or classical distinguishable and the quantum distributions all agree with the classical.<br>
                        At low temperatures bosons tend to congregate in the lowest energy individual particle state, while fermions tend to fill States one particle per state up.</em>

                    Quantum behaviour is relevant at low temperatures, while at high energies, a classical approximation is a good enough description.
                    <h2>The Fermi Distribution</h2>
                   Even though we are going to consider Bose and Fermi distributions in particular systems in the next few classes, it is convenient to take a closer look at some general features of the Fermi distribution, since it is particularly important due to its large departure from Bose and Boltzmann,
                    $$\boxed{ \mathcal{N}(E_i)={1\over B e^{E_i/k_B T}+1}}$$
                    At NOT-so-low temperatures, it looks like
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/ferm_ht.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>
                    Low energy states are fully occupied, whereas high energies states are rarely occupied.

                    <h3>Fermi energy</h3> At low enough temperatures, this behaviour becomes very sharp,
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/ferm.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>

                    Here low energy states are again fully occupied, i.e the occupation number is  one,  and at certain temperature  called the Fermi Energy $E_F$ (equal to one in this particular plot), the ocupation number is $1/2$, after which the occupation number sharply drops to zero, implying that for small temperatures all states with $ E< E_F$ are occupied, while (almost) none state with $E > E_F$ are empty!.<br><br>
                    <b> $E_F $ is defined such as $\mathcal{N}(E_F)={1\over2}$</b><br><br>
                    By using $E_F$ definition, we can compute $B$ for the Fermi distribution: 
                    $\mathcal{N}(E_F)={1\over2}$ lead us to $$B=e^{-E_F/k_B T}\,.$$ Therefore $E_F$ is a constant as long as $B$ remains a constant. <br>
                    In the homework, you are going to compute constant $B$ as a function of particle density. However, a more convenient form to write this constant (not in the homework) is: 
                    $$B= {1\over e^{\xi\over k_B T}-1} $$
                    where $\xi$ is defined as the Fermi energy at $T=0$.  An important thing to note is that this constant (in energy) does depend on Temperature.<br>
                    Pluggin back $B$ into the definition in terms of $E_F(T=0)$, we can obtain an expresion for Fermi energy $E_F$ as a function of temperature,
                    $$E_F=k_B T\ln\left(e^{\xi\over k_B T}-1\right) $$
                    of course, $E_F(T=0)=\xi$ from the last expression. In many practical applications, which happend at low energies, $E_F$ is considered a constant also in temperature,
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/ef.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>
                    Some applications that we might or might not have the time to consider, includes,
                    <ul>
                        <li>Metals:<br>
                            Under the free electron model, the electrons in a metal can be considered to form a Fermi gas, with a Fermi energy of the order of 2 to 10 electronvolts.</li>

                         <li>   White dwarfs:<br>
                             Stars known as white dwarfs have mass comparable to the Sun, but have about a hundredth of its radius. The high densities mean that the electrons are no longer bound to single nuclei and instead form a degenerate electron gas. Their Fermi energy is about 0.3 MeV.</li>

                           <li> Nucleus:<br>
                         Gases of protons and/or neutrons are also fermion gases. A typical value for the Fermi energy in suchs systems is usually given as 38 MeV.</li>
                    </ul>
