                    <h2>The simples Molecule: H$_2$</h2>
                    Even for single atoms, solving the Schrodinger equation is a very difficult task. In this  session we are not going to even try to write down the Schrodinger equation for molecules, but fortunately the hydrogen atom would once again provide us enough intuition to understand important quantum mechanics aspects of molecules. For that let us start with the simplest molecule possible two hydrogen atoms bound together. Let us remember the shape of the potential energy for single hydrogen atom,
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/hydro.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>
                    Two of these potentials with a proton separation of $a$ is given by,
                    $$U(r)={1\over 4\pi\epsilon_0}\left(-{e^2\over|r-(a/2)|}-{e^2\over|r+(a/2)|}\right)$$
                    looks something like,
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/h2.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>
                    Schematically, we can described the wave functions for this syste  by two finite wells close to each other, as shown below:<br><br>
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/two_wells.png" %}" width="800"></center><br><br>
                    As the two potentials approach to each other, bands of energy are formed containing as much states as potentials wells we have. Notice that in the molecular bands we have states of higher energy than (the corresponding) single atom energy as well as lower energies than signel atom energy.<br><br>
                    In general we will have $N-$state bands por $N-$finite wells:<br><br>
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/Nbands.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>
                    From the two-well example we can see that some wave functions inside each energy band are odd and some others are even, depending if  they component wave functions are summed in phase or half-phase. Even wave functions are bonding and odd are unbonding, as can be infered from the two well example.<br>
                    <h3>n=1 bounding and anti-bonding</h3>
                    Say we have two Hydrogen atoms both at energy $n=1$ and state $1s$ <br><br>
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/21s.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>
                    The even combination is denote by the symbol $\sigma1s$ and is known as the <b>sigma bonding orbital</b> which is typically of low energy because the electron can be close to both protons. The odd one is given by the same symbol  $\sigma^*1s$ and is known as the <b>sigma antibonding orbital</b>, typically of higher energy because the electron wnats to be closer to one or the other proton.   $\sigma1s$ states want to bond atoms together, whereas $\sigma^*1s$ want to "unbond" atoms. However,  it is a steel possible to have an antibonding state occupied in a bond molecule.
                    <br><br>
                    <em>When molecules form?</em> The short answer would be: as long as we have an energetically favorable configuration, or in other words, when the average energy of a configuration is lower than the single atoms energy:
                    <br><br><center>   <img src="{% static "img/h2_energy.png" %}" width="400"></center><br><br>  <center>   <img src="{% static "img/h2_he.png" %}" width="600"></center><br><br>
                    <h3>Other Bonds Types</h3>
                    Obviously higher energy levels will produce richer configurations (more complex), in turn more bond and unbond types of states. Lets us check very quickly the $n=2$ molecular states. Remeber that at $n=2$, a single atom can have three states (six-counting spin),<br><br>

                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/n2.png" %}" width="300"></center><br><br>
                    For each one of them three, we can  form a bond and unbonding state, as shown in the figure below,
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/2n2.png" %}" width="400"></center><br><br>
                    Called sigma bonds and anti-bonds for $\sigma2p_x$ and  $\sigma^*2p_x$, and pi bonds and anti-bonds for $\pi2p_y$, $\pi2p_z$ and  $\sigma^*2p_y$,  $\pi^*2p_z$. Again, this states bond or unbond atoms depending on the total average energy of a give configuration. Some examples of $n=2$ molecular energy levels are given below:<br><br>
                    <center>   <img src="{% static "img/n2levels.png" %}" width="500"></center><br><br>
                    Once we know all the possible energy bands states, in particular does that would average to a lower energy configuration (than single atom energies), we can just fill up states in a similar way as we have done for the atoms themselves (as we were creating the periodic table).
